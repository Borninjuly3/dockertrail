# Docker image build notes

Docker image build [option] path / url 
It builds docker images from a docker file or a context.
A build context is set of file located at the path or he url. The build process can refer to any file in context. 
url can be three things, git repository url, prepackage Tarball  and a context file.
By Defaulf docker build command looks for docker file at the root if you want to specify any other contxt you need to used --file or -f option.
In Genral the path is specifed relative to the root context.

Git reposiratory url:
All file are recursively fetched. Commit history is not preserved.  
All this are temporarily stored on local host before sending it to docker daemon; 
The context section is passed in fragments, which is separated by :  colon 
 
1) Reference that git will checkout can be a branch tag or remote reference
2) Subdirectory that will be used for build  
 
.dockerignore file : To increase the build performance you can exclude the file which are not part of build by adding them to .dockerignore 
file. Before the docker CLI send context to the daemon it look in root directory for file called .dockerigonre. f this file exists, the CLI modifies the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it.
This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them to images using

Example 

docker image build https://github.com/Borninjuly3/dockertrail.git#master:Image 

2) PAssing a file path or pasiing the file through stdin

Example 
docker build - < Dockerfile
 
 	
This command is used to build a image from a container
--add-host  adds a custom host to ip mapping 
--build-args sets a build time variable 
--cache-from : image to be consider as a cache source 
--cgroup-parent : optional parent cgroup for container 
--compress : comprrss a build contain : 
--disable-content-trust : skip image verification 
--file : name and path of the file 
--force-rm : always remove intermidate container 
--label : set metadata form image 
--no-cache : donâ€™t use cacbhe for building 
--pull : always try to pull newer version of image 
--quiet : suppress the build out put and always print image id on completion 
--rm : remove container after successful build
